        <h3>What is Push Pop Peek?</h3>
        <p>
            Push Pop Peek is a variant of tic tac toe. In fact, it's a variant of a variant! Originally, the game Score Four added a feature where the board is made larger, and where the player has the option to "stack" pieces on top of pre-existing ones. These innovations had already transformed Tic Tac Toe from a completely solved game, into a new game with exciting game dynamics. Our game, Push Pop Peek, takes this a step further, by altering the rules even more so that the "stacking" of the original Tic Stack Four game becomes a real <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)'>stack</a> data structure. Our variant of the game is designed so as to make the stack data structure play an important role in the game dynamics.
